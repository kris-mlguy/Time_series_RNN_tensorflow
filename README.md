### Time series prediction

-> A time series is a series of data points listed in time order  

-> This exercise focuses on predicting the next set of data in a time series, given a set of previous values  

-> The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model tries to predict the next set of data in a sinusoidally varying time series  
Steps: 
1) Creating a class to generate current and next batch of time series data       
2) RNN model development using tensorflow  
3) Define loss function and optimizer  
4) Run the optimizer within a tensorflow session  
5) Predicting the next set of data
